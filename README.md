Introduction
Hello, I'm a Data Engineer who recently undertook a personal project focused on Azure Data Factory, exploring data integration and transformation using Azure's powerful services. This project centered around predicting and reporting Covid-19 trends, and in this write-up, I share my experiences, learnings, and outcomes from this hands-on journey.

What I Learned
Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience with various Azure services, including Azure Data Factory, SQL Database, Blob Storage, and Data Lake Storage Gen2. Here are the key skills and knowledge areas I explored:

Azure Data Factory: Mastered creating, scheduling, and managing data pipelines for efficient data integration and transformation.
Data Integration and Transformation: Learned how to ingest data from diverse sources and transform it for analytical purposes.
Real-World Application: Applied my knowledge to build a data pipeline for Covid-19 data analysis, focusing on ingestion, processing, and analysis.
Project Overview and Structure
The project was designed to progressively build skills, starting with the basics of Azure Data Factory and advancing to more complex data flows and orchestration. I covered environment setup, data ingestion, transformation, reporting with Power BI, and concluded with best practices in CI/CD for DevOps integration.

Project Details: Covid-19 Prediction and Reporting
The core of the project involved building a comprehensive data solution for Covid-19 prediction and reporting. This included:

Data Ingestion: Sourcing Covid-19 data from various public APIs and repositories.
Data Transformation: Processing and transforming the data to prepare it for analysis.
Analysis and Reporting: Using Azure SQL Database and Power BI to analyze the data and build insightful reports.
My Experience and Outcomes
Working on this project was both challenging and rewarding. Not only did I expand my technical skills, but I also developed a deeper understanding of how data can be leveraged to address real-world issues, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The practical, hands-on approach helped solidify my learning, and completing this project gave me a tangible application of my skills.

Conclusion
Completing this project has been a significant step in my journey as a data professional. I am now equipped with the knowledge and skills to build and manage complex data integration and transformation projects using Azure Data Factory. I highly recommend hands-on projects like this to anyone interested in advancing their capabilities in data engineering and analytics.
